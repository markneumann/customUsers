Where I left off....

I took various code snippets and built the index.html and partials in the static
and partials directories.

I edited the index.html per the example in the routes chapter, converted everything
to use a Factory per the factory assignment.

I edited the partials to only have the html needed and to refer to the
controllers in the index file.

NEXT UP:

1. Think I need to install bower to pull in the angular routes library
2. Probably should go through and make sure I removed all the "product" references
2. Need to get the server running
3. Need to load the index.html file from         the server and see what breaks
4. Currently I default to the CustomerUsers page, think that works.

```
